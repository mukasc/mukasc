Hi my name is Murillo Petry,

If you got here it is because you are interested in my work, whether by indication, some connection, maybe I got in touch, or you arrived by chance.

I will start talking a little about myself, I am a geek, passionate about games, classic films, music and technology in general.

I was born and raised in Florian√≥polis, on the coast of Santa Catarina, Brazil, young and with the scope of learning I got a place in a public 
college (UDESC - Bachelor of Information Systems) I went to live alone in the countryside, in the Alto Vale do Itaja√≠, a small town called Ibirama, 
at which I currently reside.

My experiences with web development started when I started college, I received a scholarship from the technological center where I maintained the 
institutional website of some units of UDESC (CEAVI and CEO unit) working with PHP, html and mysql.

In mid-2011 I started working on a software house, which has an ERP Web solution, and started treading the path through Genexus, I have been working 
with Genexus X evo 1 for more than eight years, compiling in java web (SQL Server, DB2 and Oracle), and also using the Pattern Work With Plus.

In terms of business management modules, I worked for five years as an Analyst / Developer of the Supply Module (Purchasing, Receiving (input / freight), 
Inventory) of the ERP.

I also worked for two years doing analyzes of the Agribusiness Module (Seed Control, Receiving and Storage, Planting Plan, Seed Treatment).

After a period of analysis in agribusiness, I had a brief experience as coordinator of this team in a challenging implementation project with lean deadlines. 
This period was marked with many field visits for requirements gathering, planning using Scrum Methodology, Analysis and development.

Due to the change in management, team changes and my technical knowledge, I worked as an Analyst / Developer in several modules, such as Commercial Management 
and Billing (Integrations with service notes (webservice), sales order, Specific sales processes, note output), Production, Supplies, Clubs and also various 
demands for differentiated technological solutions such as the AnnA platform that allows you to create chatbots for different purposes.

I currently accepted the challenge and joined the Havan Labs team as a developer to help them with the challenges ahead.

Thanks!
